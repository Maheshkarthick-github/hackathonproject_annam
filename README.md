# Hackathon Project: hackathonproject_annam

## project is a submission for the Hackathon Preliminary Round, designed to classify soil images using deep learning. The project contains two tasks:

Multi-class Classification: Predict the correct soil type (e.g., Red, Black, Sandy, Loamy).

Binary Classification: Determine whether an image contains soil or not.

Both tasks utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) built using TensorFlow/Keras. The work was developed in Google Colab.

Repository Structure
