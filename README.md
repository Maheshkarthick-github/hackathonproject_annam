# Hackathon Project: hackathonproject_annam

## Overview
This project is a submission for the Hackathon Preliminary Round. The goal of this project is to analyze a dataset and derive meaningful insights using data processing and visualization techniques. The dataset used in this project contains [e.g., "sales data from 2020-2024"]. The project was developed using Google Colab and includes a Jupyter notebook with data preprocessing, analysis, and visualizations to showcase the results.

## Repository Structure
- `README.md`: Project overview and setup instructions.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the project locally.
- `notebooks/project_analysis.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the project code.
- `data/`: Folder containing the dataset (or a sample, if the dataset is too large).
- `outputs/`: Folder containing output files like visualizations.

## How to Run in Google Colab (Recommended)
1. **Open the Notebook in Colab**:
   - Download the `notebooks/project_analysis.ipynb` file from this repository: [https://github.com/Maheshkarthick-github/hackathonproject_annam](https://github.com/Maheshkarthick-github/hackathonproject_annam).
   - Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and upload the `project_analysis.ipynb` file by selecting `File > Upload notebook`.

2. **Set Up the Dataset**:
   - If the dataset is included, itâ€™s in the `data/` folder as `sample_data.csv`.
   - If not included, download the dataset from [provide a link or instructions, e.g., "Kaggle: <link>"] and upload it to Colab using the file upload feature in the notebook.

3. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute all cells.
   - The notebook will process the dataset and generate visualizations, which will be displayed inline or saved to the `outputs/` folder.

## How to Run Locally (Optional)
If you prefer to run the notebook locally:
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Maheshkarthick-github/hackathonproject_annam.git
   cd hackathonproject_annam
