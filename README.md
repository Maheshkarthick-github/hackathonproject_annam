# Hackathon Project: hackathonproject_annam

## Overview
This project is a submission for the Hackathon Preliminary Round. The goal of this project is to classify soil types using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The dataset consists of soil images, which are processed and classified into different categories using a deep learning model built with TensorFlow/Keras. The project was developed using Google Colab and includes a Jupyter notebook with data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Repository Structure
- `README.md`: Project overview and setup instructions.
- `competition_soil_classification_2.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the project code.

**Note**: The dataset and output files (e.g., visualizations, trained model) are not included in this repository due to size constraints. Instructions to access the dataset are provided below.

## How to Run in Google Colab (Recommended)
1. **Open the Notebook in Colab**:
   - Download the `competition_soil_classification_2.ipynb` file from this repository: [https://github.com/Maheshkarthick-github/hackathonproject_annam](https://github.com/Maheshkarthick-github/hackathonproject_annam).
   - Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and upload the `competition_soil_classification_2.ipynb` file by selecting `File > Upload notebook`.

2. **Set Up the Dataset**:
   - The dataset consists of soil images used for classification. It is not included in this repository due to size constraints.
   - Upload the dataset to Colab by following the instructions in the notebook (e.g., using the file upload feature or mounting Google Drive).

3. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Execute all cells in the notebook as per the instructions provided within.
   - The notebook will load the dataset, preprocess the images, train the CNN model, and evaluate its performance.
   - Visualizations (e.g., accuracy/loss plots) will be displayed inline.

## How to Run Locally (Optional)
If you prefer to run the notebook locally:
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Maheshkarthick-github/hackathonproject_annam.git
   cd hackathonproject_annam
